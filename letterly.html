Under the Soviet Union and later under the Lukashenko regime, the Belarusian language was pushed aside in favor of the Russian language, which is used more than Belarusian in most parts of the country. This course will teach you the official Belarusian orthography, instead of Taraškievica, an older system sometimes used in the Belarusian diaspora.</p>

Historically, Middle Bulgarian was spoken in a much larger area in the Second Bulgarian Empire. Because of this, there are still many Bulgarian speaking towns in southern Ukraine and Moldova.

A few hundred years ago, a large group of Chinese-speaking Muslims migrated to Central Asia, who eventually became the Dungan people. Under the Soviet Union, a Cyrillic alphabet was developed for the language which is still used to this day. Dungan speakers cannot understand Mandarin Chinese very well anymore after centuries of separation.</p>

The national language and language of interethnic communication is Macedonian, a Slavic language which is related to both Serbian and Bulgarian. In terms of orthography and grammar, Macedonian is very simple compared to other languages of the region- it was codified around the late 1800s and early 1900s as the Ottoman Empire began to collapse.

Today, the Mongolian nation has been reduced to a small inland republic between Russia and China with a few million people. Due to influence from the Soviet Union, Mongolia adopted the Cyrillic alphabet to replace their traditional alphabet. The traditional alphabet, which is written top-to-bottom, is still used about Mongolians in China- but this course will only teach the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet.</p>

Uzbeks also form around 15% of the population in both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Until recently, Uzbekistan used the Cyrillic alphabet to write their language, but the government promoted a shift to the Latin alphabet after the Soviet Union collapsed. The transition to the Latin alphabet never fully took place, so both Latin and Cyrillic are used. Therefore, I created the following course to teach the Uzbek Cyrillic alphabet. Note that in Afghanistan, a version of the Arabic alphabet is used.</p>

There are over 300 million Arabic speakers in the world and it is an official language in 26 countries! In addition, Arabic is the liturgical language of Islam (the second largest religion on Earth) and one of six official working languages of the United Nations. Wherever Islam went, from Senegal to Suriname to Spain, Arabic impacted the local language and provided many loan words (many like Algebra and kebab have come into English).</p>

                    <p>Persian is the national language of the Islamic Republic of Iran as well as a national language in Afghanistan, where it is called Dari. In ancient times, many strong empires such as the Sassanids and the Achaemenids used Persian as their state language, which was written in a variety of alphabets. Today, a variant of the Arabic script is used to represent Persian, reflecting the rise of Islam in the region.</p>

                    <p>Upon independence from Britain, Pakistan decided to use Urdu as its national language and language of interethnic communication. Urdu and Hindi are often considered to be dialects of the same 'Hindustani' language- the main difference is that Urdu is written in a form of the Arabic script and has some influence from Persian. Outside of Pakistan, Urdu has official status in some states in India and is spoken by the Pakistani diaspora around the world.</p>

                <h2>Information</h2>
                <div class="levelpanel">
                    <p><b>Introduction:</b> There are around fifty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_writing_systems" target="_blank">writing systems</a> around the world that are used in some official capacity. The majority are written from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system#Directionality" target="_blank">left-to-right</a>, but others such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet" target="_blank">Hebrew</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script" target="_blank">Arabic</a> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left_script" target="_blank">right-to-left</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_script" target="_blank">traditional Mongolian script</a> is even written top-to-bottom. Most writing systems do not differentiate between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case" target="_blank">capital and lowercase letters</a>.</p>
                    <p><b>Types of writing systems:</b> While you would think most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system" target="_blank">writing systems</a> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet" target="_blank">alphabets</a>, that is systems with one symbol per sound, the most common system is actually the abugida. In an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida" target="_blank">abugida</a>, consonants are the letters, and the way in which they are modified indicates a vowel. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_family_of_scripts" target="_blank">Chinese script</a> is well-known for being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram" target="_blank">logographic system</a>; each symbol represents a word. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana" target="_blank">Japanese</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_syllabary" target="_blank">Cherokee's</a> writing systems are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary" target="_blank">syllabaries</a>, or systems in which each letters represents a syllable. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script" target="_blank">Arabic</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet" target="_blank">Hebrew</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_alphabet" target="_blank">Syriac</a> scripts are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad" target="_blank">abjads</a>; systems where all letters are consonants and vowels are optional/unwritten.</p>
                    <p><b>Most popular systems:</b> The most widespread writing system in the world by far is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script" target="_blank">Latin script</a> (the one you are reading now) while the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_writing_systems#List_of_writing_scripts_by_adoption" target="_blank">most popular</a> would be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_family_of_scripts" target="_blank">Chinese script</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script" target="_blank">Cyrillic script</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari" target="_blank">Devanagari</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script" target="_blank">Arabic script</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali%E2%80%93Assamese_script" target="_blank">Bengali-Assamese (Eastern Nagari) script</a>.</p>
                    <p><b>Origin of writing:</b> Even though written language seems like an obvious invention, it was only independently created twice in history. First in the present-day Sinai peninsula (northwestern Egypt) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Sinaitic_script" target="_blank">Proto-Sinaitic</a> script was invented around 3,500 to 4,000 years ago- it later spread to become the Greek, Cyrillic, Roman, Arabic, Burmese, Thai, and Ethiopic scripts (among many others). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone_script" target="_blank">Oracle bone script</a> started appearing in China around 3,000 years ago, and it later evolved into different writing systems for Korean, Japanese, and Chinese.</p>
                    <p><b>Invention of writing systems:</b> Some writing systems like Greek and Chinese slowly evolved over millenia, other alphabets were invented by one or two people at some point in history. The Adlam, Armenian, Osage, and Tibetan scripts for example were all created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_creators_of_writing_systems" target="_blank">people</a> who saw the need for a way to transcribe their own language. Despite there being dozens examples of script creators, it appears that only men have taken this task upon themselves, though hopefully there will be scripts created by women in the future.</p>
                    <p><b>Numeral systems: </b>Many writing systems don't use the international set of numerals (0123456789). For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarati_script" target="_blank">Gujarati script</a> uses a different set (૦૧૨૩૪૫૬૭૮૯). Almost every writing system in South Asia and Southeast Asia has its own set of numerals, though more languages are normalizing the use of international digits. Some right-to-left writing systems like the Arabic script (٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩) and more contemporarily the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanifi_Rohingya_script" target="_blank">Hanifi Rohingya script</a> (𐴰𐴱𐴲𐴳𐴴𐴵𐴶𐴷𐴸𐴹) have digits that are written from left-to-right. However, some recently invented right-to-left scripts such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adlam_script" target="_blank">Adlam</a> (𞥐𞥑𞥒𞥓𞥔𞥕𞥖𞥗𞥘𞥙) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%27Ko_script" target="_blank">N'ko</a> (߀߁߂߃߄߅߆߇߈߉) have numbers written from right-to-left.</p>
                    <p><b>Punctuation: </b>When writing sentences, we use a variety of punctuation marks to clarify meaning. Some examples include the exclamation mark (!), the semicolon (;), and the ellipsis (...). Some languages have adopted parts of Western punctuation, but many languages have their own symbols. Arabic punctuation is similar to an inverted form of Western punctuation, with its question mark being '؟', its comma being '،', and its semicolon being '؛'. N'ko has completely innovative punctuation, ߹ is the exclamation mark and ߸ is the comma. Not all punctuation marks in other writing systems have Western equivalents, and many punctuation marks are becoming obsolete.</p>
                    <p><b>Unicode: </b>This website would not be possible without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode" target="_blank">Unicode</a>, an international standard which lets nearly any writing system in the world be displayed on the internet. It is basically an international standard which makes all fonts, operating systems, and software compatible with any language. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_Consortium" target="_blank">Unicode Consortium</a> also regulates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji" target="_blank">emojis</a>.</p>
