Orthography I
The Osage language uses its own alphabet which is completely separate from the Latin alphabet used for English. However, many of the letters are reminiscient of ones found in the English alphabet, making it very easy to learn. For example, 𐓒 looks like the letter Z and makes the same sound. Another example is how 𐒵 looks like a combination of C and h and makes the 'Ch' sound.
"𐒰: 'a' as in 'all'",
"𐓀: 'm' as in 'mall'",
