        <h3>Table Game Optimal Strategy Database</h3>
        <p>The goal of this project is to use mathematics to find the exact optimal strategy for every extant casino table game.</p>
        <p>Anyone is welcome to contribute! <a style="color: orange" href="mailto:harrismowbray@yahoo.com?subject=Casino%20Website">Email me</a> if you want to contribute strategies to the site</p>
        <p>This symbol ✅ means a game is "confirmed optimal", meaning we did the math to find the exact best strategy possible.</p>
        <h2>Poker-Based Games</h2>
        <p>Due to their complexity, most of these games have not been optimally solved, with a few exceptions 😔</p>
        <h4 id="3shotpoker">3 Shot Poker ✅</h4>
        <p>Fold unless your cards are a pair, your cards are the same suit, or if they form the inside of two different potential straights (like how 4 and 5 can make 345 or 456, but Ace and King can only make one potential straight).</p>
        <p>If Straights pay 5:1 on your pay table, don't fold if your cards form any part of a potential straight (for example 4 and 6 are separated but have the potential to make 456).</p>
        <h4 id="caribbeanstudpoker">Caribbean Stud Poker ✅</h4>
        <p>Always raise with a pair or better</p>
        <p>Always fold with less than an Ace+King</p>
        <p>The Wizard of Odds website has <a href="https://wizardofodds.com/games/caribbean-stud-poker/optimal-strategy/" target="_blank">a chart</a> explaining what to do if you have an Ace+King</p>
        <p>Do this correctly, and you will have a house edge of <b>5.2243%</b></p>
        <h4 id="casinoholdem">Casino Hold'Em</h4>
        <p>Optimally you will only fold 18% of the time</p>
        <p>It can definitely be said that you should raise with a pair or better, or if you have four cards of the same suit.</p>
        <p>I found a convoluted strategy within 0.29% of optimal, but more detailed strategies should be investigated.</p>
        <h4 id="crazy4poker">Crazy 4 Poker</h4>
        <p>Until extremely recently, the general rule here was to fold if you didn't have a K+Q+8+4 or better. Now with modern computers we can find the true optimal strategy.</p>
        <p>K+Q+8+4+3 and K+Q+7+6+5 should be folded if there are two suits, and K and Q are different suits.</p>
        <p>You should fold on K+Q+8+4+2 if King and Queen are different suits</p>
        <p>This might be the complete optimal strategy, I am in the process of verifying!</p>
        <h4 id="dakotadueldraw">Dakota Duel Draw ✅</h4>
        <p>Play if one card is nine or higher, Play if your cards form a pair, and Play if your cards are the same suit (except for 3-8, 2-8, and 2-7), otherwise Fold.</p>
        <p>Do this correctly, and you will have a house edge of between <b>2.57%-5.29%</b>, depending on the pocket bonus pay table.</p>
        <h4 id="djwild">DJ Wild ✅</h4>
        <p>Play if you have a pair of fives of better. If you just have a pair of threes or no pair, Fold.</p>
        <p>If you just have a pair of fours, Fold if you also have a three, otherwise Play.</p>
        <h4 id="floppoker">Flop Poker ✅</h4>
        <p>Raise if you have at least one card jack or higher, a pair, three to a flush, or three to any straight, otherwise fold.</p>
        <h4 id="fourcardpoker">Four Card Poker</h4>
        <h5>Simple Strategy</h5>
        <p>Raise x3 with a pair of tens or better, raise x1 with a pair of twos or better, and to fold otherwise.</p>
        <h5>Advanced Strategy</h5>
        <p>Pair of Aces or better: Bet x3</p>
        <p>Pair of Kings: Bet x3, except bet x1 against an Ace and you don't have an Ace nor 4.</p>
        <p>Pair of Queens or Jacks: Bet x3, except bet x1 if the dealer's card outranks pair your pair rank and does not match a singleton in your hand.</p>
        <p>Pair of 9s or 10s: Bet x3, except bet x1 if dealer card outranks your pair rank.</p>
        <p>Pair of 8s: Bet x1, except bet x3 against a 2</p>
        <p>Pair of 4s thru 7s: Bet x1</p>
        <p>Pair of 3s: Bet x1, except fold against a Jack if your highest kicker is a 10 or lower</p>
        <p>Pair of 2s or AKQ: Fold, except bet x1 if dealer card matches a rank in your hand</p>
        <p>AKJT: Fold, except bet x1 against a Jack</p>
        <p>AKJ9 or lower: Fold</p>
        <p>I have heard rumors that gambling expert <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Grosjean" target="_blank">James Grosjean</a> has developed an even more advanced strategy.</p>
        <p>My analysis also shows that you should actually bet x1 with AKJ9 if the dealer is showing an Ace or King :)</p>
        <h4 id="headsupholdem">Heads Up Hold'Em</h4>
        <p>Raise x4 if you have an Ace, if you have a King with 5-Queen, if you have a Queen with a 8-Jack, or a Jack with a 10.</p>
        <p>Additionally raise x4 if you have a suited King with anything, a Queen with 6 or 7, or a Jack with 8 or 9.</p>
        <h4 id="jackpotholdem">Jackpot Hold'Em</h4>
        <p>The Wizard of Odds website includes <a href="https://wizardofodds.com/games/jackpot-hold-em/#strategy" target="_blank">some strategic analysis</a> of this game, but much more research is needed.</p>
        <h4 id="letitride">Let It Ride</h4>
        <p>'Let it ride' if you have a paying hand or four cards of the same suit, more strategy research must be done to find the perfect strategy.</p>
        <h4 id="mississippistud">Mississippi Stud ✅</h4>
        <p>When you have two cards: raise x3 any pair or better, raise if you have a Jack-Ace, if both cards are 6-10, or if you have 5/6 suited, otherwise fold.</p>
        <p>The rest of the strategy is hard to summarize (I'll do it later), but it can be found on <a href="https://wizardofodds.com/games/mississippi-stud/#strategy">a chart</a> on the Wizard of Odds website.</p>
        <h4 id="texasholdembonus">Texas Hold'Em Bonus</h4>
        <p>If you need a straight or better to win on the Ante, fold a 2 with a 3-7 if they have different suits.</p>
        <p>If you need a flush or better to win on the Ante, fold a 2 with a 3-7 if they have different suits, or an unsuited 3+4.</p>
        <p>More research is needed to find the optimal moves for the next decisions.</p>
        <h4 id="threecardpoker">Three Card Poker ✅</h4>
        <p>Play if you have a Q+6+4 or better, otherwise Fold. This will yield you a <b>3.37%</b> to <b>4.28%</b> house edge.</p>
        <h4 id="threecardprime">Three Card Prime ✅</h4>
        <p>Play if you have a Q+6+4 or better, otherwise Fold. This will yield you a house edge of <b>2.96%</b>.</p>
        <h4 id="threecardthunder">Three Card Thunder</h4>
        <p>The strategy will be released alongside the game in December</p>
        <h4 id="ultimatetexasholdem">Ultimate Texas Hold'Em</h4>
        <p>Raise x4 if you have an Ace, if you have a King with 7-Queen, if you have a Queen with a 10 or Jack</p>
        <p>Additionally raise x4 if you have a suited King with 5 or 6, a Queen with 8 or 9, or a Jack with 10.</p>
        <h4 id="wildcardstudpoker">Wild Card Stud Poker ✅</h4>
        <p>Play if you have a pair of fives of better. If you just have a pair of threes or no pair, Fold.</p>
        <p>If you just have a pair of fours, Fold if you also have a three, otherwise Play.</p>

        <h4 id="bigsix">Big Six ✅</h4>
        <p>If there are eight spots with "5", it means "5" is the best bet with <b>11.1111%</b> house edge. Otherwise "1" is the best bet with <b>11.1111%</b> house edge.</p>

        <h4 id="3dicebaccarat">3 Dice Baccarat ✅</h4>

        <h4 id="craps">Craps ✅</h4>
