                    Most cards are worth their face value, face cards are worth 10, and aces are worth 1 or 11. To get a baccarat hand's value, divide the total of the cards by ten and get the remainder. If either hand has a value of 8 or 9, it's time to pay out. If the Player hand has a value of 5 or less, the Player gets a third card. If the Player does not get a third card, the Banker gets a third card if their value is 5 or less.<br>Things get complicated after a Player gets a third card. If the Banker hand has a value of less than three, they will draw. If the Banker hand's value is 4, they draw if the Player hand's third card is 2-7. If the Banker hand's value is 5, they draw if the Player hand's third card is 4-7. If the Banker hand's value is 6, they draw if the Player hand's third card of 6 or 7. If the Banker hand's value is 7, no drawing occurs.
